- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dylan Armstrong, I am currenttly in between my junior and senior years at Utah State University. 
- Iâ€™m interested in game development, algorithmic trading, robotics, and game theory. Outside of my computer science interests I enjoy tabletop gaming, books by Brandon Sanderson, and musical theater.
- Iâ€™m currently taking a year off from school. I'm taking this time to learn new skills and focus on some personal coding projects. Right now I am learning about game development in C# using the framework Monogame.
- You can reach me most easily at dylan.armstrong299@gmail.com
